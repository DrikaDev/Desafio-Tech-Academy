                            <h1>Mario story</h1>
                            <p>"In 1980, Nintendo tried to make a game based on Popeye 
                                cartoon, however, Nintendo did not get the copyright 
                                from "King Features Syndicate" and had to change its 
                                strategy. In order not to lose the game, they asked 
                                Shigeru Myamoto to design a new game where he could creat 
                                a character based on his own ideas. The result was the 
                                Donkey Kong game where a "Jump Man" had to save his 
                                girlfriend Pauline from the gorilla. Mario was created 
                                to replace Popeye, Pauline took the place of Olivia and 
                                Donkey Kong took the role that was from Brutus.</p>

                            <h1>Mario´s mustache and name</h1>
                            <p>They decided to gave to this "Jump Man" a huge mustache 
                               because they wanted him to look like a human being, and 
                               because of this, people realized that the character looked 
                               like a Nintendo employee called Mario Segale (actually, 
                               Mario Segale was the owner of the building where Nintendo 
                               rented in USA). So they had the brillant idea to change the 
                               name from "Jump Man" to "Mario" in honor of him.</p>

                            <h1>Mario´s curiosities</h1>
                            <p>Originally, Marios was a carpinter (in my opinion it was because 
                               of those stairs he had to climb in the Donkey Kong game to save 
                               Pauline), but after so many pipes he literally had to pass through, 
                               he was then consider a plumber. Some of the character details was 
                               created to disguise the bad quality of the graphics:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mario wears a cap because the 8-bit graphics didn't allow him to have well done hair.</li>
                                <li>His nose is big to stand out in the small character.</li>
                                <li>His big mustache was created to hide the mouth he doesn't have.</li>
                                <li>“It's-a me, Mario!” and “Let's-a Go!” are phrases that you can hear in the first game where his voice is given thanks to Charles Martinet who also created the voices for Wario, Luigi and even Donkey Kong!</li>
                            </ul>

                                his brother, and in addition, they created a more elaborate story, 
                                with well-defined objectives and villains increasing Mario's powers and
                                a lot of friends who got together to save the Princess Peach, captured 
                                by the terrible monster Bowser Koppa.</p>
